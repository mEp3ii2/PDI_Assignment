WwcDataRet.java
needs a command line argument to run
please type in the full filename and path if needed so that the application
can run accordingly 

data.csv is the file produce by the data entry application and a test file has been made called testdata.csv if you need

the application for analyising the data works on the assumption that the data is entered in its expected format from the data
entry application therefor error handling for file isnt really implemented besides checking that the file isnt empty
